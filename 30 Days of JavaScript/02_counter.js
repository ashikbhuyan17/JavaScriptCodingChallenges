    Post-increment (n++):
    Post-increment is like saying, "Use the current value of n, and after you've used it, increase it by 1." For example, if you have n = 5, 
    and you write x = n++, 
    what happens? x gets the current value of n (which is 5), and then, as a polite gesture, n increases to 6.
    
    Pre-increment (++n):
    Pre-increment, on the other hand, is more direct. It's like saying, "Increase the value of n by 1 first, and then use the new value."
    Suppose n = 5. If you write x = ++n, this time, n becomes 6 immediately, and x receives that new value. So, x gets 6, and n is also 6.
